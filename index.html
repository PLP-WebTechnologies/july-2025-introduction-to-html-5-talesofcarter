        <h2>Python</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Did you know that Python was named after the British comedy group
            "Monty Python" and not the reptile?
          </p>
          <p>
            Python was used in the production pipeline for Star Wars and The
            Avengers by Industrial Light & Magic.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Did you know that JavaScript is the only language that runs natively
            in all web browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was originally developed by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in 1995.

        <h2>Rust</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Rust ensures memory safety at compile time, avoiding common bugs
            like null pointer dereferencing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was designed to be a systems programming language with a focus on
            speed, memory safety, and parallelism.

      <section>
        <h2>Go</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Unlike Java or C++, Go doesn’t use class-based inheritance—favoring
            composition instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go was created by Google engineers (including Rob Pike, one of the
            Unix pioneers) in 2009.

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Java was first named “Oak,” inspired by an oak tree outside the
            developer’s office.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java was the primary language for Android development for many
            years.
